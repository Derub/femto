``femto`` is an open-source package for the design of integrated optical circuits.
The library consists of a growing list of parts and modules, which can be composed to construct complex optical components and large circuits.
The optical components can be plotted and exported to a .pgm file for the fabrication of the circuit.

The following optical components are implemented:

* Multiscan and Nasu Waveguide class, allowing easy chaining of bends and straight segments. Including:

    - Circular and sinusoidal arcs
    - Directional couplers
    - Mach-Zehnder interferometers
    - Spline segments and 3D bridges

* Trench class, allowing easy generation of complex toolpaths for arbitrary geometries
* Marker and superficial ablation class
* Possibility to draw bitmap images

The G-Code file is generated by a dedicated compiler class that allows performing various geometric transformations on the optical components like:

* Translations
* Rotations
* Homothetic transformations, for refractive index change compensation
* Flip transformations along `x`- or `y`-axis
* Compensation for sample warp

The different structures can be organized into single cell-like objects, which allow:

* Collecting different structures of a circuit
* 2D and 3D representations of the stored objects
* Automatized generation of G-Code files
* Export plots in different formats
